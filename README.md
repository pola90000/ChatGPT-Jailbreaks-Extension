# ChatGPT-Jailbreaks-Extension

## Description

The GPT Jailbreak Extension is a browser extension that allows users to apply custom "jailbreaks" to ChatGPT, an AI language model, on the [OpenAI GPT-3 platform](https://openai.com). These jailbreaks modify the behavior of ChatGPT, enabling users to interact with the AI in different ways based on their preferences.
